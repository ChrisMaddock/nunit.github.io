NUnit's documentation has moved from its former GitHub wiki to a new site at https://docs.nunit.org. The site is now built from the content at [nunit/docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/nunit/docs).

[Sean Killeen](https://SeanKilleen.com) has joined the NUnit team as the new lead of the docs project. We welcome Sean to the project, and look forward to seeing everyone's great contributions to the docs going forward!
