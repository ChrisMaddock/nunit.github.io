<h2>From NUnit 2.x</h2>

<p>In general, there are two approaches to running tests built against earlier
   versions of the NUnit framework from 2.0 through 2.5.10:

<ol>
<li>Run the tests without recompilation. This is the best approach when no
    further changes are to be made to a project. Ensure that the framework
    assembly against which the tests were built continues to be avaialble
    in the test directory.
<li>Recompile the tests referencing the latest version of the framework assembly.
    This is usually the best option when a project is still under development.
</ol>

<p style="margin-left: 3em"><b>Note:</b>
   NUnit 2.6 no longer recognizes "old style" test cases - those
   identified by a name beginning with "Test". If you have such tests, you will
   need to convert them to use the <a href="test.html">TestAttribute</a>   and recompile your tests. In such cases, it makes sense to recompile against
   the latest framework.

<h2>From NUnit 1.x</h2>

<p>Tests originally compiled against a version of NUnit prior to 2.0 will need
   to be rewritten and recompiled in order to run under NUnit 2.6.
